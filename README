DESCRIPTION
    This software adds XML output support to "Class::DBI" based objects.

  to_xml_columns
      Class->to_xml_columns([qw[columns to dump with xml]]);

    This class method sets the default columns this class should dump when
    calling "to_xml()" on an object. The single parameter is a list
    reference with column names listed.

  to_xml
      my $xml = $object->to_xml(
                    columns => {
                        MyApp::User  => [ qw[username email zip_code] ],
                        MyApp::File  => [ qw[user filename size]      ],
                        MyApp::Pref  => [ MyApp::Pref->columns        ],
                    },
                    depth => 10,
                    xml => {
                        NoAttr => 0,
                    },
                );

    All arguments are optional.

    "columns" - A hash reference containing key/value pairs associating
    class names to a list of columns to dump as XML when the class is
    serialized. They keys are class names and values are list references
    containing column names, just as they'd be sent to "to_xml_columns()".
    Passing a "columns" parameter to this instance method will override any
    defaults associated with this object. Failing that, "to_xml_colunms()"
    is checked and failing that, the "Primary" and "Essential" columns are
    dumped by default.

    Each column requested for XML output will go through an attempt to be
    stringified. If the column value is an object with stringification
    overloaded (using "overload") then it is stringified in that manner. If
    the column is an object and its interface supports either "as_string()"
    or "as_text()" methods, those method will be called and the results
    returned. Finally, if the value is defined then it is stringified and
    returned (this means references will become ugly). If the value is
    undefined then an empty string is used in its place.

    "depth" - Depth to dump to. Depth of zero, the default, will not
    recurse. Column values are interogated to determine if they should be
    recursed down. If the column value is an object whose API supports the
    "to_xml()" method, then that method will be called and the resulting XML
    will be parsed via "XMLin()" from "XML::Simple". The root node will not
    be kept when converting the XML back into a data structure.

    "xml" - Hash reference of XML::Simple options. Change these only if you
    really know what you're doing. By default the following options are set.

      NoAttr   => 1,
      RootName => $self->moniker,
      XMLDecl  => 0,

  create_from_xml
      my $new_user = MyApp::User->create_from_xml($xml);

    Creates a new user from an XML document. The document is parsed with
    "XMLin" and the root node is thrown away. All information passed in to
    this method is ignored except the tags that match column names.

EXPORTS
    This module is implemented as a mixin and therefore exports the
    functions "to_xml", "create_from_xml", and "_to_xml_stringify" into the
    caller's namespace. If you don't want these to be exported, then load
    this module using "require".
